#nodebb-plugin-calendar

This plugin for NodeBB allows people to put a configurable widget on their website which shows their Teamspeak server's details.

##Installation

Two options:

 1.  Install the plugin through the ACP (if it ever gets added to the list *cough cough*)
 2.  Run `npm install nodebb-widget-teamspeak` in the root directory of the NodeBB install

Don't forget to restart after installing the plugin. After installing, a new Teamspeak widget should appear next to the rest

##Configuration
All one must do is, in the NodeBB Admin area, go to Themes > Widgets, drag the widget wherever you want, and configure the options for the widget.

##Features
* Show how many users are online in the Teamspeak server
* Can be themed easily
* Shows the server info and a click on the title or link will open the Teamspeak server in the client
* Can show the full channel tree, and users can be themed by server group, and channels can be themed by channel type
